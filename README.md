# Movie Seat Booking Webapp (Frontend)

This is a basic movie seat booking web application that allows users to:

- Select a movie from a dropdown menu.
- Choose seats from a visual representation.
- See the total and ticket price dynamically.
- Save seats, movie and price to local storage so that UI is still populated on refresh
